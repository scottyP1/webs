        <h2>****What Is RSV****</h2>
        <p>
                Respiratory syntactical (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV,<br>
                is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild,
                cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious,
                especially for infants and older adults. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis
                (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs)
                in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Currently, There is no RSV vaccine or immunization approved for use in all babies.<br></strong></p>
        <p>
            The goal of this line is to spread awareness of RSV to family members and
            friends to parent's of young children. I have heard many stories of family members not listening to parents
            about the dangers of what can spread to children. The lack of knowledge on this kills children and hospitalizes
            thousands every year. This line not only is intended to educate but to help prevent the spread,
            but to also help fund organizations to help find a cure. We have found a group that is currently in the process
            of researching a potential vaccine that could change the lives of so many children.
            Purchasing from us helps fund something that could help a family.
